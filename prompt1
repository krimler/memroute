**GENERATE 100 QUESTIONS with this distribution:**

| single_hop | 20 | summary | Simple fact lookup |
| single_session | 15 | stm | Current session reference |
| recent_session | 15 | ltm | Past conversation reference |
| multi_hop | 10 | summary, ltm | Connects facts across stores |
| memory_capacity | 15 | ltm, episodic | "List all", exhaustive recall |
| temporal | 15 | ltm, episodic | "Before X", historical comparison |
| knowledge_update | 10 | summary, ltm | Current state vs history |

**OUTPUT FORMAT (JSON array):**
```json
[
  {
    "query": "What allergies does the user have?",
    "answer": "penicillin",
    "alt_answers": ["shellfish"],
    "stores": ["summary"],
    "type": "single_hop"
  },
  {
    "query": "Who was the user's manager before the reorg?",
    "answer": "michael torres",
    "alt_answers": ["michael", "torres"],
    "stores": ["ltm", "episodic"],
    "type": "temporal"
  }
]
```

**RULES:**
1. `answer` should be lowercase, the primary expected answer
2. `alt_answers` are alternative acceptable answers (also lowercase)
3. `stores` is the minimal set of stores needed to answer
4. Questions should be natural and varied (not repetitive phrasing)
5. For "list all" questions, answer should be one item, alt_answers should have others
6. For temporal questions, use "before", "originally", "previously", "changed from"
7. For multi_hop, require combining info from multiple stores
8. Ensure answers actually exist in the memory content above
